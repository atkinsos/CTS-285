<h2>Games included: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Starmath Race - Using the calculator's memory you could enter 10 problems into the calculator, which it then suggested you hand to a friend and get them to solve the 10 maths problems.</li>
<li>Electro Flash - A timed game to practice your addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division tables. Players were rewarded with "a special light show" for their hard work!</li>
<li>Number Guesser - Guess the number that Dataman is thinking of in as few guesses as possible!</li>
<li>Wipe Out - A multi-player game against Dataman. Each player must solve a problem and pass it on to the next player to solve the next problem, against an invisible timer. When the timer stops the person holding the calculator is out. The last person playing is the winner.</li>
<li>Force Out - A multi-player subtraction game. Starting at a number chosen by Dataman, each player must subtract a number from the next answer. Whoever ends at zero is the loser. Also suggests the game 'First Out' where the first person to get to zero is the winner.</li>
<li>Missing Number Game - Fill in the missing number in the equation.</li>
<li>Orbit Math - Using a game board in the manual two or more players set each other three maths problems. Correct answers allow you to progress along the board, the first to reach the sun at the end wins!</li>
</ul>
